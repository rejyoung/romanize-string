# romanize-string

## 1.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Internal: Reorganized repo into a pnpm monorepoâ€”moved the package to `packages/romanize-string`, added a workspace root with `pnpm --filter` scripts, centralized dev deps (`@changesets/cli`, `npm-run-all2`), and set the root to `private`. No public API changes.
