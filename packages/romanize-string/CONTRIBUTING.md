## Development Guidelines

- Ensure code is formatted consistently.
- Use clear commit messages.
- Document any new functionality or changes in behavior in the README or Technical Notes section as needed.

## Community Standards

- Be respectful in discussions and reviews.
- Recognize that language-specific contributions are particularly valuable here — native speakers and experts are especially encouraged to help improve transliteration quality.
- Improvements to transliteration accuracy, especially for specific languages, will need to come from community contributions. As the project owner, I do not have the expertise to address those issues alone.

Thank you for helping make **romanize-string** better!
